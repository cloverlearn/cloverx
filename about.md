Hello, 

<br>

Thank you for your interest in the cloverX theme. CloverX is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme build to be used for [CloverLearn](https://www.cloverlearn.com) blog. 

<br>

I created CloverX as a hobby in need for my blog. I have tried different themes out there and coudn't 
find one that suits my needs: simplicity and minimalism. So I took matters in to my hand and designed and developed this theme.
This theme is based on popular [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) css framework. As of now, no other external packages are used.

<br>

You can also contribute to this project by suggesting new features, fixing bugs, and updating documentation. Use `pull request` and `issues` functions in [GitHub](https://github.com/cloverlearn/cloverx) for such communications.

<br>

If you need direct communication with me, you can find me at [ysenarath.com](https://www.ysenarath.com).

<br>

Cheers,
<br>
Yasas
